First Create a folder.( Working Directory)
Initiate git using the command : git init -b main ( by changing the bt=ranch name to main )
Configure the user to that folder :
git config user.name "alias name " ( This name will be shown in the git log file)
git config user.email "emailaddress"

To push to a repository : 
Create a remote repoisitory.

try git remote -v ( this will show the list of remote repositories that are configured succesfully)
try ssh -T git@github-alias-name to check if the authentication is successful.
If( authentication is succesful ){
    Hi Username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
}
else {
    error
}

if error :
Add the remote Repository 
git remote add origin git@github-alias-name:username/repo.git

try :ssh -T git@github-alias-name to check if the authentication is successful.

if still shows error 
git remote set-url origin git@github-alias-name:username/repo.git
try : ssh -T git@github-alias-name to check if the authentication is successful. 


Now we can see that the remote is accessible.

  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa1


Host github-account2
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa2
